#include <vector>

/*
 * Goal: Return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence
 *
 * Intuition:
 * Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived by deleting some of the elements
 * By brute force we can try to start from every index since we finding the subsequence
 * And at every index we can choose to include or not, information we need to pass is index and also last element index
 * Time Complexity will be O(2^N)
 * Can be improve by caching where caching[i] = longest subsequence from i to n
