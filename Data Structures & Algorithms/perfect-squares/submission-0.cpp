/*
 * Goal Find the least number of perfect square that sum up to n
 *
 * Intuition:
 * We have to keep recursively to solve the problem until we can reach n by keep trying from the least perfect square
 * and then just take the minimum
 * We can improve it by using caching since this is a recursive problem and we can see there is some overlapping problem
 * The caching will be 1d array because we only pass 1 information while doing the recursive
