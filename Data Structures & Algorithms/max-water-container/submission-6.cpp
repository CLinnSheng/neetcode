/*
 * There are n vertical lines
 * Goal: Return the maximum amount of water a container can store
 *
 * Intuition:
 * The naive way will just simply have 2 nested loop that will try all possible sizes of container.
 * But this will take O(n^2)
 *
 * How can we optimize it? To O(n) or others?
 * Area = Length * Height
 * Since we cannot control the length but we can control the height.
 * We also need to be greedy at the same time.
 * We can use 2 pointer approach, every time we will move the pointer with the lower heights
 * Time Complexity: O(N)
