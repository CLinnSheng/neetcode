/*
 * Goal: Return true if you can partition the array into 2 subset such that the sum in both subsets s equal or false
 * otherwise
 *
 * Intuition:
 * Find "subset" immediately know is a tree decision problem. So at every index we can either choose or not choose.
 * And also another key observation is the 2 subset sum is equal so basically is the total sum divide by 2. If the total
 * sum is odd means cannot be partitioned equally
 * So by using brute force, we will just simply use dfs and at each point we can either include or not include, so when
 * the sum is equal to half of the ttlSum, that means we can form a subset as those not included also can make it sum.
 * But the time complexity will be O(2^n)
 *
 * we can optimize it by using caching. But how do we implement it?
 * Just cache the result, so whenever we face the same problem can straight away use it
 * So 2d or 1d? Based on the brute force dfs, so everytime we pass down the index and target so basically we need 2d
 * array Time Complexity: O(n * sum(nums)) Space Complexity: O(n * sum(nums)) --> MLE
