/*
 * Deleting a node in BST
 * So same rule applies to how we apply insertion
 * But over here we need to take care of how to relink the tree after deletion
 *
 * So everytime we delete a node, we need to find a node to replace its existing position?
 * So which node should we refer to? The next element greater than the node being replaced
 * How do we find it, go to the right part of the tree then keep traverse to the end on the left
 *
 * Multiple Case of Deletion
 * 1. Leaf Node -> Just simply return nullptr
 * 2. Has only one child -> Just replaced by the child
 * 3. Has 2 child -> Then need to find the next element greater than it
 *
 * Use recursion and rebuild the tree by keep returning the subtree
