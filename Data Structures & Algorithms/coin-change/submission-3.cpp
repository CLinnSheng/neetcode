/*
 * Given an integer array coins
 * Goal: Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount.
 *
 * Intuition: At amount we will try different number of coin first, and then
 * keep going down using naive approach will be O(2^n) Actually we can see
 * theres a lot of overlapping problem for example if we already have the answer
 * for choosing 'x' amount, we dont have to recompute, just use the existing
 * solution This leads us to dp. Since the number of coins is infinite, we only
 * need 1D array
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(m * n)
 * Space Complexity: O(m)
