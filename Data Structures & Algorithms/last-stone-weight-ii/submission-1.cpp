/*
 * Each turn choose any 2 stone and smash them together
 * Result of smash got 2 possibilities
 * 1. x == y, both stones are destroyed
 * 2. x != y, push the new diff weight
 *
 * Goal: Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone otherwise 0 if no stone
 *
 * Intuition:
 * Need to find the way to choose 2stones such that the weight of the left stone is minimal
 * We think it in another way is actually like partitioning the stones into 2 groups such that the differnce
 * between their sum is minimized.
 * Eg: [1,3,2,4] --> [1,[3,2,4]] / [[1,3],[2,4]] / [[1,3,2],4]
 * so for every subset we need to repeat the same thing as well
 * So brute force basically just trying all possible subset
 * We trying to minimize sum(A) - sum(B) which is same as minimizing total - sum(B) - sum(B) --> total - 2 * sum(B)
 * Time Complexity: O(2^n)
 *
 * Observe from the recursive dfs, we can actually see doing some computation multiple times
 * We can improve it through caching/memoization
 * We pass 2 information every recursive, so the array will be 2d
 * Time Complexity: O(ttlSum/2 ^2)
 * */
